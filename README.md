NixOS is a Linux-distribution based on the nix-package-manager. Its biggest strength is its declarative nature, which ultimately leads to reproducible builds.

## Current issues

- [ ] KDEs notification-daemon is overwritten by dunst

## Todo

### Options

- [ ] Configure dunst via home-manager
- [ ] Install and configure gammastep (successor to redshift)
- [ ] Find out, how to configure Displayport-Audio (on x1 Carbon)
  - As an aside: It's working flawlessy on KDE Neon
